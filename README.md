<br>

To create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, start by setting up a 3x3 grid in HTML with div elements for each cell and a restart button. Use CSS to style the grid and cells, making them visually appealing and ensuring they are responsive. Implement the game logic in JavaScript to handle player moves, check for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals), and manage game state. Finally, add functionality to the restart button to allow players to reset the game without refreshing the page.
